### This module is part of the HR management tool and includes these features:
- HR can create a form with questions and send it to employees.
- Employees receive the form, fill it in, and submit it.
- After they submit, the AI gives recommendations about which skills the employee should improve.
- HR and Team Leads can see all answers in a table and in charts.
- The charts show:
      - Each question
      - Each answer
      - How many employees chose each answer
- Team Leads can send feedback to employees, and HR can also see this feedback.
